# 4. Rewrite requests for specific static asset directories to /public/
# This rule only applies if the asset isn't already directly in public/ (handled by rule 2).
# And it makes sense if your assets are typically requested as /css/file.css
# but physically reside at /public/css/file.css

# 5. All other routes go to index.php (the router)
# This rule catches everything else that hasn't been handled above.
